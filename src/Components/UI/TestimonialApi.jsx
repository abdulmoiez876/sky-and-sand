        review: "Sky and Sand is the best site I've seen to find the ideal hotel to stay at. I highly recommend using it. And then when you find the hotel you want to stay at, the best thing to do is go to that hotel's website and book directly through them. You will pay the same price and the hotel appreciates you booking directly through them so they don't have to pay a fee to the middleman. Sometimes they will will thank you by giving you a free drink or some other freebie. Also when you book directly with the hotel it is more likely that you will actually get the room that you request. You will also probably have an easier time changing or cancelling the reservation if necessary. I hope this helps.",
